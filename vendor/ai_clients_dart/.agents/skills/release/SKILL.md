# Release Skill for ai_clients_dart

This skill handles the full release lifecycle for the ai_clients_dart monorepo.
It supports three execution modes controlled via `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **`/release --plan`** — Plan-only mode: detects changes, computes bumps, shows release plan. No file edits, no publish, no tags. Safe to run on any branch.
- **`/release --dry-run`** — Dry-release mode: does everything including file edits and `dart pub publish --dry-run`, but stops before actual publishing/tagging/committing. Always restores the working tree before exit (on both success and failure).
- **`/release`** — Full release mode: the complete workflow.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the mode. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--plan`, run in plan-only mode. If it contains `--dry-run`, run in dry-run mode. Otherwise, run in full release mode.

---

## Step 1: Validate Environment

Perform all applicable checks before proceeding. Fail fast with an actionable error message if any check fails.

1. **Branch check** (full release mode only):
   Must be on `main` branch. In `--plan` and `--dry-run` modes, any branch is allowed (but warn the user that results may differ from main).
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current  # must output "main" in full release mode
   ```
2. **Clean working tree**: No uncommitted changes.
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain  # must be empty
   ```
3. **Up-to-date with remote** (full release mode only):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git rev-parse origin/main)"  # HEAD must equal origin/main
   ```
   In `--plan` and `--dry-run` modes, skip this check.
4. **CLI availability**: `dart` and `gh` must be on PATH.
5. **Auth preflight** (skip in `--plan` mode):
   - **GitHub**: `gh auth status` — must show authenticated. If not, tell user to run `gh auth login`.
   - **pub.dev**: There are two authentication mechanisms:
     - **OAuth session** (from `dart pub login`) — this is the primary and recommended method. It does NOT appear in `dart pub token list`.
     - **Token-based** (from `dart pub token add`) — these appear in `dart pub token list` but are less common.
   - **Do not assume unauthenticated just because `dart pub token list` is empty.** An active OAuth session is invisible to that command.
   - **Reliable verification**: Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` in any package directory as the auth smoke test. If it succeeds (exit code 0, no auth errors), authentication is working regardless of the mechanism.
     ```bash
     cd packages/{any_pkg} && dart pub publish --dry-run 2>&1
     ```
   - If the dry-run fails with an authentication error, tell the user to run `dart pub login` (OAuth, recommended) or `dart pub token add https://pub.dev` (token-based, alternative).

---

## Step 2: Detect Changes Per Package

> **IMPORTANT — Working directory**: All `git` and shell commands throughout this skill assume the **repository root** as the working directory. The Bash tool does not persist `cd` between calls, so **always use absolute paths or prefix commands with a quoted repo path, for example `REPO_ROOT="/path/to/repo"` then `cd "$REPO_ROOT" && ...`, when running shell commands**. Never rely on a previous `cd` having set the working directory. This applies to every step, not just this one.

### Discover packages

Read the `workspace` list from the root `pubspec.yaml` (the source of truth). Each entry is a relative path like `packages/foo`. Extract the package directory name from each path (the last segment). If parsing fails, fall back to `ls packages/`.

### For each package

1. **Find last release tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag --list "{pkg}-v*" --sort=-v:refname | head -1
   ```
   This sorts by semver (not creation date) to find the latest version tag.

2. **Get commits since that tag**:
   ```bash
   git log --format="%H|||%s|||%b|||END" {tag}..HEAD -- packages/{pkg}/
   ```
   Use `|||` as field delimiter and `|||END` as record terminator. **Parse by splitting on `|||END` first** (to get individual commit records), then discard any empty records from the result (the final terminator produces a trailing empty element). After filtering, split each remaining record on `|||` **into at most three parts** (hash, subject, body) so any additional `|||` sequences in the subject or body remain inside the body field. Do not blindly split on every occurrence of `|||`. Avoid using ASCII control characters (`%x1f`, `%x1e`) as delimiters — they can be silently stripped or mangled by shell processing, leading to empty results.

3. **No previous tag** (first release): use all commits touching `packages/{pkg}/`.

4. **Filter out non-publishable changes**: If `packages/{pkg}/.pubignore` exists, read its lines as ignore entries. `.pubignore` supports gitignore-style syntax, but **for this release filtering step, only treat entries that are simple directory names** (with or without trailing `/`, no wildcards, `!` negation, or additional `/` path separators) as ignore directories relative to `packages/{pkg}/` (typically names like `.agents`, `.claude`, `specs`). Skip blank lines and lines starting with `#` (comments). Any more complex patterns in `.pubignore` should be ignored for this filtering logic and must not cause a commit to be misclassified as non-publishable.

   For each commit found in step 2 (or step 3 for first releases), check which files it actually changed within the package:
   ```bash
   git show --pretty="" --name-only {hash} -- packages/{pkg}/
   ```
   If **every** changed file falls under one of the supported `.pubignore` directory-name entries (i.e., for some listed directory `DIR`, the path starts with `packages/{pkg}/DIR/`, such as `packages/{pkg}/.agents/` or `packages/{pkg}/specs/`), **exclude that commit** — it has no effect on the published package. Only retain commits that touch at least one file outside these ignored directories.

   > This prevents internal tooling changes (AI agent configs, spec files, etc.) from triggering unnecessary releases. The commit is still recorded in git history but is not considered for version bumps or changelog entries.

5. **No commits since tag** (after filtering): provisionally note this package for skipping — but **always continue to Step 6** to check for unreleased version bumps before finalizing the skip decision.

6. **Detect unreleased version bumps**: Compare the `version:` field in `packages/{pkg}/pubspec.yaml` against the version extracted from the latest tag:
   ```bash
   # Extract version from latest tag (e.g., "foo_dart-v1.0.0" → "1.0.0")
   tag_version=$(echo "$latest_tag" | sed "s/^${pkg}-v//")
   # Read pubspec version
   pubspec_version=$(grep '^version:' packages/${pkg}/pubspec.yaml | awk '{print $2}')
   ```
   - If `pubspec_version` > `tag_version`, this package has a **pre-applied version bump** — someone manually set the version in the pubspec but never published it. Flag this package for release even if Step 5 found "no commits since tag" would normally skip it.
   - If `pubspec_version` == `tag_version` and there are no new commits, skip as normal.

   > **Caution**: The git tag is the definitive indicator of whether a version has been published, not the pubspec. A pubspec may show `version: 1.0.0` while no `{pkg}-v1.0.0` tag exists — this means 1.0.0 was never actually released. Always check tags to determine published state.

---

## Step 3: Parse Commits and Determine Version Bumps

### Parse each commit subject as a conventional commit

Format: `type(scope)!: description`

- Extract `type`, optional `scope`, optional `!` (breaking indicator), and `description`.
- Also check the commit **body** for `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (case-insensitive).

### Classify changes

**Release-triggering types** (only these cause a version bump):
| Type | Bump |
|------|------|
| `feat` | minor |
| `fix` | patch |
| `refactor` | patch |
| `perf` | patch |
| `docs` | patch |

> Note: `docs` and `perf` as patch bumps are intentional and match this repo's conventions, even though some tools treat them as non-release.

**Non-release types** (include in changelog notes but do NOT trigger a version bump):
| Type |
|------|
| `test`, `chore`, `build`, `style`, `ci` |

**Breaking change override**: If a commit has a breaking change (`!` suffix OR `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body), it **always triggers a release** regardless of type — override bump to **major**. This applies to non-release types too (e.g., `build!: Require Dart >=3.8.0` triggers a major bump). Historically this repo has `**BREAKING** **BUILD**:` entries that triggered releases.

### Determine version bump per package

Take the **highest** bump across all commits that trigger a release for each package:
- major > minor > patch
- If the package has ONLY non-release commits **with no breaking changes** (test, chore, etc.) → skip the package (no release).

### Pre-1.0 packages (current major version is 0)

- Breaking change → bump **minor** (not major)
- `feat` → bump **patch** (not minor)
- Ask user if they want to promote to 1.0.0 instead

### Handle build metadata

If the current version has `+N` build metadata (e.g., `0.3.0+1`), strip the `+N` before bumping. The new version will not have build metadata.

### Pre-applied version bumps

If Step 2.6 detected that a package's pubspec version is ahead of its latest tag version:

1. **Pubspec version >= computed bump version**: Use the pubspec version as-is. The version was intentionally set (e.g., a 1.0.0 rewrite) and should be respected.
2. **Computed bump would be higher than pubspec version**: Warn the user and ask which version to use. This is unusual and may indicate a mistake (e.g., someone set a patch bump manually but breaking changes were added later).
3. **Changelog scope**: In either case, include **all commits since the last tag** in the changelog, not just commits since the pubspec was changed. The tag marks the last published state, so all changes since then are unreleased.

---

## Step 4: Present Release Plan for Confirmation

**In all modes (`--plan`, `--dry-run`, full):** display the release plan.

Show a summary table:

```
| Package | Current Version | New Version | Bump Type | # Commits |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| foo_dart | 1.2.3 | 1.3.0 | minor | 5 |
```

Then list commits per package, grouped by:
1. **Release-triggering commits** (feat, fix, refactor, docs, breaking)
2. **Non-release commits** (test, chore, build, etc.) — shown for awareness but labeled as "will not affect version"

**Ask user to confirm** before proceeding. They may override bump types or skip specific packages.

**If `--plan` mode**: STOP here. Do not proceed to any file edits.

---

## Step 5: Write Changelogs

For each released package, **prepend** a new section to `packages/{pkg}/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changelog section format

```markdown
## {new_version}

> Note: This release has breaking changes.          ← only if breaking

{AI-written summary of main changes, 1-3 sentences}

- **BREAKING** **FEAT**: Description ([#N](https://github.com/davidmigloz/ai_clients_dart/issues/N)). ([abcd1234](https://github.com/davidmigloz/ai_clients_dart/commit/{full_40_char_hash}))
- **FEAT**: Description. ([abcd1234](https://github.com/davidmigloz/ai_clients_dart/commit/{full_40_char_hash}))
- **FIX**: Description. ([abcd1234](https://github.com/davidmigloz/ai_clients_dart/commit/{full_40_char_hash}))
```

### Formatting rules

1. **Remove package scope** from entries: `feat(googleai_dart): Foo` → `**FEAT**: Foo`
2. **Short hash** in display = first **8 characters** of the commit hash
3. **Full 40-char hash** in the commit URL
4. **Extract issue numbers** from:
   - `(#N)` in the commit subject — there may be **multiple** references (e.g., `(#913) (#914)`); collect all of them
   - `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Resolves #N` in the commit body
   - Render all collected issue numbers in the order they appear: `([#913](...)) ([#914](...))`
   - If no issue number found, omit the issue link portion entirely
5. **Ordering within the changelog section**:
   - BREAKING entries first (any type with breaking change)
   - Then release-triggering types: FEAT, FIX, REFACTOR, PERF, DOCS
   - Then non-release types (if included): BUILD, STYLE, CI, TEST, CHORE
   - Within each type group, sort by **commit date descending** (newest first)
6. **All links in new changelog entries** must point to `https://github.com/davidmigloz/ai_clients_dart` (older historical entries may still reference `davidmigloz/langchain_dart` — leave those as-is)
7. **Standard markdown list**: `- **TYPE**: ...` (no leading space)
8. **Breaking note**: Only include `> Note: This release has breaking changes.` if there are breaking changes
9. **AI summary**: Write 1-3 sentences summarizing the main changes in plain English. Place it between the breaking note (if any) and the entry list.

### Pre-existing changelog sections

Before writing a new changelog section, check if `## {new_version}` already exists in `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. **Detection**: Match `^## {new_version}` (exact version, at start of line) in the file.
2. **If the section already exists**:
   1. **Review the existing content for quality**: Pre-existing sections may be draft notes, rough bullet points, or incomplete text from a PR. Read the content carefully and ensure it is polished, well-structured, and presentable as a published changelog. Fix grammar, formatting, missing links, or unclear descriptions. Ensure it follows the same formatting conventions as the rest of the changelog (bold type prefixes, issue/commit links, ordering rules defined above).
   2. **Append** a `### Commits` subsection at the end of the existing section with the auto-generated commit entries (using the standard formatting rules above). This preserves the hand-written narrative while adding the structured commit log.
   3. If the existing section lacks a breaking change note but the commits include breaking changes, add the `> Note: This release has breaking changes.` line at the top of the section (after the `## {version}` heading).
3. **If the section does not exist**: Proceed with normal prepend behavior as described above.

---

## Step 6: Update pubspec.yaml Versions

For each released package, update the `version:` field in `packages/{pkg}/pubspec.yaml` to the new version.

---

## Step 7: Dry-Run Publish (before committing!)

Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` from each package directory:
```bash
cd packages/{pkg} && dart pub publish --dry-run
```

Present the results and **ask user to confirm** before actual publishing.

If there are **errors** (not warnings):
- Stop and **restore the working tree** (revert tracked changes and remove generated artifacts):
  ```bash
  git checkout HEAD -- packages/
  git clean -fdX packages/    # remove ignored/generated files (e.g., .dart_tool/, build outputs)
  ```
- Report which packages had errors and what the errors were.

**If `--dry-run` mode**: After showing the dry-run results, **restore the working tree** and STOP:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- packages/
git clean -fdX packages/
```

---

## Step 8: Publish

**Only in full release mode.**

Publish packages **one at a time**, in workspace order (as listed in root `pubspec.yaml`). Currently no packages depend on each other, but if inter-package dependencies are added in the future, dependencies must be published before their dependents.

```bash
cd packages/{pkg} && dart pub publish --force
```

If any package **fails** to publish:
1. Stop immediately
2. Report which packages succeeded and which failed
3. **For unpublished packages**, restore their files from HEAD:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- packages/{pkg}/pubspec.yaml packages/{pkg}/CHANGELOG.md
   ```
4. Only packages that were **successfully published** proceed to the commit/tag steps

> **Warning**: Published packages cannot be unpublished from pub.dev. If a partial failure occurs, the already-published packages will be live on pub.dev but the repo won't yet have the corresponding commit/tags. The operator **must** continue with Steps 9-11 for the successfully published packages to bring the repo into a consistent state. Do not abandon the process after a partial publish.

---

## Step 8b: Reconciliation Checkpoint

**Only in full release mode.** Perform this checkpoint after all publish attempts (Step 8) and before committing (Step 9).

1. **Display a checklist** of all packages from the release plan with their publish status:
   ```
   | Package | Planned Version | Status |
   |---------|-----------------|--------|
   | foo_dart | 1.0.0 | Published |
   | bar_dart | 2.1.0 | Published |
   | baz_dart | 0.5.0 | FAILED |
   | qux_dart | 1.3.0 | Skipped (user request) |
   ```

2. **Verify completeness**: Every package from the release plan must be accounted for with one of these statuses:
   - **Published** — successfully published to pub.dev
   - **Failed** — publish attempted but failed (files reverted per Step 8)
   - **Skipped** — user explicitly chose to skip during Step 4

3. **Flag any unaccounted packages**: If any planned package is missing from the checklist (neither published, failed, nor skipped), this is an error. The package was likely overlooked. Stop and resolve before proceeding.

4. **Require user confirmation** before proceeding to Step 9.

> **Why this checkpoint exists**: Discovering a missed package after committing and tagging (Steps 9-10) requires messy fixups — amending commits, re-tagging, force-pushing. Catching omissions here is far cheaper. Take 30 seconds to verify completeness now to avoid 30 minutes of cleanup later.

---

## Step 9: Commit Changes

**Only in full release mode.**

Create a single commit with all `pubspec.yaml` and `CHANGELOG.md` changes (only for successfully published packages):

```bash
git add packages/{pkg1}/pubspec.yaml packages/{pkg1}/CHANGELOG.md \
       packages/{pkg2}/pubspec.yaml packages/{pkg2}/CHANGELOG.md \
       ...
```

Commit message format:
```
chore(release): publish packages

 - {pkg1}@{version1}
 - {pkg2}@{version2}
```

**Why commit after publish**: If publish fails for some packages, we don't pollute main with version bumps for unpublished packages.

---

## Step 10: Create Git Tags

**Only in full release mode.**

1. **Per-package tags**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a "{pkg}-v{version}" -m "{pkg} v{version}"
   ```

2. **Aggregate release tag** — compute once and reuse in Step 11:
   ```bash
   # Determine the aggregate tag name
   base_tag="release-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   aggregate_tag="$base_tag"
   if git rev-parse "$aggregate_tag" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     counter=1
     while git rev-parse "${base_tag}.${counter}" >/dev/null 2>&1; do
       counter=$((counter + 1))
     done
     aggregate_tag="${base_tag}.${counter}"
   fi
   git tag -a "$aggregate_tag" -m "Release ${aggregate_tag#release-}"
   ```
   Store `$aggregate_tag` for use in Step 11.

3. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

---

## Step 11: Create GitHub Release

**Only in full release mode.**

Create one combined GitHub release using the `gh` CLI. Use the **exact `$aggregate_tag` value** computed in Step 10 (which may include a `.N` counter suffix for same-day re-releases).

- **Tag**: `$aggregate_tag` (from Step 10)
- **Title**: the date portion of the tag (e.g., `2026-03-03`)
- **Body**: summary table of all packages + full changelog sections per package

Body format:
```markdown
## Packages released

| Package | Version |
|---------|---------|
| [pkg1](https://pub.dev/packages/pkg1) | v1.2.3 |
| [pkg2](https://pub.dev/packages/pkg2) | v2.0.0 |

---

## pkg1 v1.2.3

{changelog content for pkg1}

---

## pkg2 v2.0.0

{changelog content for pkg2}
```

Create the release:
```bash
gh release create "$aggregate_tag" \
  --title "${aggregate_tag#release-}" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
{body content}
EOF
)"
```

---

## Edge Cases

1. **No previous tag** → use all commits since the package first appeared in the repo
2. **Only test/chore commits** → skip package (no release)
3. **Build metadata versions** (e.g., `0.3.0+1`) → strip `+N`, bump the base version
4. **Commits with no scope** touching package files → include them, use the full description
5. **Commits with non-matching scope** but touching package files → include them
6. **No issue number** → omit issue link, keep commit link
7. **Pre-1.0 packages** → breaking bumps minor, feat bumps patch (confirm with user if they want to promote to 1.0.0)
8. **Partial publish failure** → report status, revert unpublished packages, only commit/tag published ones
9. **Cross-package commits** → file-path detection handles correctly (same commit may appear in multiple packages)
10. **Aggregate tag collision** → append counter suffix (`.1`, `.2`, etc.)

---

## Resuming an Interrupted Release

If the release process is interrupted (e.g., context window exhausted, network failure, user abort), use the following guidance to determine current state and resume safely.

### Determine current state

Run these commands to assess where the release stopped:

```bash
# 1. Check for uncommitted release changes (pubspec.yaml, CHANGELOG.md edits)
git status --porcelain

# 2. Check for a release commit on HEAD
git log -1 --oneline  # look for "chore(release): publish packages"

# 3. Check for per-package tags on HEAD
git tag --points-at HEAD

# 4. Check if tags have been pushed
git fetch origin --tags
git log -1 --oneline origin/main  # compare with local HEAD

# 5. Check for a GitHub release
gh release list --limit 5

# 6. Check pub.dev for published versions
# For each package in the release plan:
dart pub global activate pana  # if needed
curl -s https://pub.dev/api/packages/{pkg} | grep '"version"' | head -1
```

### Progress checkpoints

To enable safe resumption, write a progress file after each major step:

```bash
cat > /tmp/release-progress.md <<'EOF'
# Release Progress — {date}

## Plan
| Package | Target Version | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| foo_dart | 1.0.0 | published |
| bar_dart | 2.1.0 | changelog written, not published |
| baz_dart | 0.5.0 | pending |

## Completed Steps
- [x] Step 1: Environment validated
- [x] Step 2-3: Changes detected, bumps computed
- [x] Step 4: Plan confirmed
- [x] Step 5: Changelogs written (all packages)
- [x] Step 6: pubspec.yaml updated (all packages)
- [x] Step 7: Dry-run passed
- [x] Step 8: Published foo_dart
- [ ] Step 8: Publish bar_dart, baz_dart
- [ ] Step 8b: Reconciliation
- [ ] Step 9: Commit
- [ ] Step 10: Tags
- [ ] Step 11: GitHub release

## Last Updated
{timestamp}
EOF
```

Update this file after completing each step. A new session can read it to resume.

### Recovery table

| Interrupted After | State | Recovery Procedure |
|---|---|---|
| **Step 4** (plan confirmed) | No files modified yet. | Start fresh from Step 5. |
| **Steps 5-6** (changelogs/pubspec written) | Working tree has uncommitted changes. | Verify the changes with `git diff`. Resume from Step 7 (dry-run publish). |
| **Step 7** (dry-run passed) | Working tree has uncommitted changes, dry-run validated. | Resume from Step 8 (publish). |
| **Step 8** (some packages published) | Some packages live on pub.dev, uncommitted changes in tree. | **Critical**: Check which packages are published (`curl -s https://pub.dev/api/packages/{pkg}`). For unpublished packages, revert their files (`git checkout HEAD -- packages/{pkg}/pubspec.yaml packages/{pkg}/CHANGELOG.md`). Resume from Step 8b with only the published packages. |
| **Step 8b** (reconciliation done) | All publishes complete, user confirmed, uncommitted changes. | Resume from Step 9 (commit). |
| **Step 9** (committed) | Release commit exists locally, not pushed. | Resume from Step 10 (create tags). |
| **Step 10** (tags created) | Commit and tags exist locally, not pushed. | Resume from the push command in Step 10 (`git push origin main --tags`). Then proceed to Step 11. |
| **Step 11** (GitHub release) | Everything done except GitHub release. | Check `gh release list`. If the release doesn't exist, create it per Step 11. If it exists but is incomplete, use `gh release edit` to update the body. |

> **Critical rule**: If **any** packages have been published to pub.dev (Step 8), you **must** complete Steps 9-11 for those packages. Published packages without corresponding tags and commits leave the repository in an inconsistent state. Never abandon the process after a partial publish.
